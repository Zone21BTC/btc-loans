  "introduction": "Lava enables instant USD loans using Bitcoin collateral through its self-custody wallet, requiring no credit checks or KYC. Launched circa 2023, it uses on-chain guarantees and leverages DLCs for trustless lending.",
  "highlights": "Innovative DLC-based model hampered by closed-source key generation and a single price oracle; in a DLC setup the entire contract integrity hinges on oracle robustness. Open-sourcing the wallet and adopting multiple independent, attestable oracles could quickly elevate Lava to a top-tier lender.",
