  "introduction": "Hodl Hodl is a global, non-custodial Bitcoin lending platform that uses multisig escrow contracts to secure collateral. The platform does not require KYC, supports peer-to-peer lending, and allows users to retain control over their keys, but relies on a closed-source wallet for key generation.",
  "highlights": "Core vulnerability is the closed-source wallet that generates the borrower's key directly in the browser, creating a wide attack surface. Open-sourcing that code (or letting users bring their own key) would close the main gap.",
