  "introduction": "Founded in 2018 and based in the Cayman Islands, Ledn offers Bitcoin-backed loans. Borrower collateral sits in cold, insured vaults at BitGo Trust Company, and the platform backs its controls with a SOC 2 Type II attestation and semi-annual proof-of-reserves.",
  "highlights": "Ledn's Custodied Loans score well for CeFi: borrower BTC stays segregated in BitGo's cold, insured vaults, and the firm has survived the bankruptcy wave that sank early Bitcoin lenders during 2022-23 while maintaining a long-running incident-free record. Improvement areas remain: liquidations still rely on a single undisclosed price feed, and Ledn's cold-to-hot wallet operations lack an independent audit.",
