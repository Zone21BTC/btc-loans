  "introduction": "Launched in 2025, Strike offers Bitcoin-backed loans with native BTC as collateral and in-house custody. The platform provides fixed-rate 12-month loans with USD delivery, featuring a conservative 50% LTV and 35% liquidation buffer.",
  "highlights": "Elevated risk stems from in-house custody, hidden reserves, and undisclosed price feeds. Moving collateral to a bankruptcy-remote regulated custodian, supplying PoR or per-loan UTXOs, and revealing pricing sources are priority fixes.",

      "note": "Omnibus custody with self-declared segregation (no external audit). Strike's bitcoin-backed loan collateral is not held by a regulated third-party custodian with formal bankruptcy-remote arrangements. Instead, collateral BTC is either kept in Strike's own custody or transferred to \"trusted\" third-party capital partners who fund the loans. Strike confirms that these coins are held in segregated wallets and never re-hypothecated (i.e. not lent out or mixed elsewhere). However, this segregation is an internal policy – Strike remains legally responsible for the collateral during the loan, so client BTC is not explicitly ring-fenced from Strike's corporate estate via any independent trust or custodian. No public audit or proof-of-reserves is in place yet."
