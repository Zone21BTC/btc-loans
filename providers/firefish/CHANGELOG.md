**Action:** update
**By:** tocomax
**Commit:** [22ca6440](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/22ca6440)
**Message:** feat: update Firefish's score and notes

### Changed
- **highlights:** `Chief weaknesses are the browser-generated borrower key and a setup that blocks blinded oracles, limiting user privacy and plausible deniability. Open-sourcing the wallet code and migrating to a blinded oracle setup would sharply improve privacy and resilience.` → `Chief weaknesses are the browser-generated borrower key and a setup that blocks blinded, independent oracles, limiting user privacy and plausible deniability. Independent audit and migrating to DLCs with blinded oracles are next steps toward a safer model.`
- **factors.security_governance.note:** `Borrower keys are generated by closed-source browser code with no public audit, so their quality and secrecy are unverifiable. 
Firefish's in-house Price and Payment oracles each hold a signing key and co-sign almost every PSBT. Notably, the Payment Oracle has unilateral power to mark a default and liquidate the BTC. Because these keys see every transaction and can't be blinded like DLC oracles, they effectively function as admin cosigners (not independent feeds) and the role can't be outsourced or given plausible deniability.` → `The borrower client is open-source with deterministic builds.

- **factors.transparency.score:** `7` → `4`
- **factors.transparency.note:** `Each borrower can see their escrow UTXO.
Firefish states, "The App is open source software that can be compiled and run by the Borrower on their own hardware," but since no evidence link is provided, it is still considered closed-source.` → `Each borrower can see their escrow UTXO. Firefish has open-sourced only the borrower WASM client (not the full platform) and provides deterministic build instructions so technical users can reproduce the binary. The docs caution the live platform may differ from the reference; back-end/oracle code remains closed, and the repo says the code is published for review/auditing, not development. In practice, most users can't easily verify the web app serves the same build, so transparency is improved but still partial.`
