Notably, the Payment Oracle has unilateral power to mark a default and liquidate the BTC. Because these keys see every transaction and can't be blinded like DLC oracles, they effectively function as admin cosigners (not independent feeds) and the role can't be outsourced or given plausible deniability.",

          "from": "Each borrower can see their escrow UTXO.\nFirefish states, \"The App is open source software that can be compiled and run by the Borrower on their own hardware,\" but since no evidence link is provided, it is still considered closed-source.",
          "to": "Each borrower can see their escrow UTXO. Firefish has open-sourced only the borrower WASM client (not the full platform) and provides deterministic build instructions so technical users can reproduce the binary. The docs caution the live platform may differ from the reference; back-end/oracle code remains closed, and the repo says the code is published for review/auditing, not development. In practice, most users can't easily verify the web app serves the same build, so transparency is improved but still partial."
