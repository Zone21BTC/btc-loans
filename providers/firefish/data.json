  "introduction": "Founded in 2022 and headquartered in Prague, Firefish is a non-custodial, peer-to-peer marketplace that locks bitcoin collateral in on-chain multisig escrow, letting borrowers obtain fiat or stablecoin liquidity while lenders earn yield (no rehypothecation).",
  "highlights": "Chief weaknesses are the browser-generated borrower key and a setup that blocks blinded oracles, limiting user privacy and plausible deniability. Open-sourcing the wallet code and migrating to a blinded oracle setup would sharply improve privacy and resilience.",
