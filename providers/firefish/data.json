  "introduction": "Founded in 2022 and headquartered in Prague, Firefish is a non-custodial, peer-to-peer marketplace that locks bitcoin collateral in on-chain multisig escrow, letting borrowers obtain fiat or stablecoin liquidity while lenders earn yield (no rehypothecation).",
  "highlights": "Chief weaknesses are the browser-generated borrower key and a setup that blocks blinded, independent oracles, limiting user privacy and plausible deniability. Independent audit and migrating to DLCs with blinded oracles are next steps toward a safer model.",

The docs caution the live platform may differ from the reference; back-end/oracle code remains closed, and the repo says the code is published for review/auditing, not development. In practice, most users can't easily verify the web app serves the same build, so transparency is improved but still partial.",
