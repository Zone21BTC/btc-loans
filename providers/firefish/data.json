  "introduction": "Firefish is a Bitcoin-backed lending platform that uses browser-generated keys and a unique setup that blocks blinded oracles. The platform is non-custodial, supports instant liquidations, and does not require KYC, but has limitations in user privacy and oracle diversity.",
  "highlights": "Chief weaknesses are the browser-generated borrower key and a setup that blocks blinded oracles, limiting user privacy and plausible deniability. Open-sourcing the wallet code and migrating to a blinded oracle setup would sharply improve privacy and resilience.",
