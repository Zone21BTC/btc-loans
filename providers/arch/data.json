It serves individuals and institutions, offering USD or stablecoin financing with concierge-level customer support from a non-bank, NMLS-registered entity.",
  "highlights": "Anchorage custody in bankruptcy-remote trusts is a solid base, but Arch publishes no public proof of reserves and liabilities and discloses no SOC 2 for its own platform.
