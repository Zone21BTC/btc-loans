  "introduction": "Founded in 2022 in New York, Arch (operated by ChainFi, Inc.) delivers crypto-backed loans using BTC, ETH, and SOL as collateral. It serves individuals and institutions, offering USD or stablecoin financing with concierge-level customer support from a non-bank, NMLS-registered entity.",
  "highlights": "Uses native BTC escrow but offers no public proof-of-reserves and depends on a single oracle, leaving users blind to hidden leverage or price-feed failure. Live PoR and multiple independent pricing sources would materially shrink uncertainty.",
